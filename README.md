> **Brief Description:** This project implements a dog and cat image classification model using the pre-trained ResNet-101 architecture with the PyTorch library. The model is fine-tuned on the Microsoft Cats and Dogs Dataset to distinguish between images of dogs and cats.


## üìä Dataset

### Dataset Information

- **Name:** Microsoft Cats and Dogs Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle (downloaded via the provided Microsoft link)
- **Size:** Approximately 25,000 images (after removing corrupted files), split into training and validation sets.
- **Format:** JPEG image files.

## üß† Model Architecture

The project utilizes the ResNet-101 model, pre-trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset. The final fully connected layer of the ResNet-101 model is modified to output predictions for two classes: 'Cat' and 'Dog'.


## üìà Results

The notebook provides a visualization of sample predictions and a comparative error analysis.
